A required group project for our Programming 2 subject throughout the entire 2nd semester.

This project is published on Github as a way for our group to gain valuable learning oppportunities in utilizing the platform. 
Through this platform, we hope to learn best practices in version control, collaboration, and communication within a development team.
Publishing our project on Github offers a hands-on learning experience that can help us further develop our skills as newbies in 
the Information Technology field, specifically in Programming.

This group project <b>only utilizes arrays</b> and <ins>does <b>not</b></ins> involve the <ins>use of any permanent database or storage</ins> for entries.
**This project also uses the basics of C#. No LINQs and other more advanced topics.**

<ins> Code will hopefully be refactored in the future. </ins>

# C# Program Description and Features
## Description
The Traffic Ticket Registry System is yet another tool for managing traffic tickets and violation records. It simplifies the task of record-keeping by providing an intuitive and user-friendly command-line interface for logging in, registering new violation tickets, and searching for specific ones. Additionally, users can view all tickets or filter them by category such as viewing only violations under the “No License” category. This centralized approach streamlines the process of handling traffic violations, reducing administrative burden and improving accuracy. Ultimately, it contributes to better management and resolution of traffic-related incidents.

## Features
- **Login System**
  - **User Authentication:** Ensures that only authorized personnel can access the system. Users must provide valid credentials to log in.
    
- **Main Menu**
  - After logging in, users are presented with a main menu that provides access to all the application's functions. Options include registering new tickets, searching for tickets, viewing tickets and logging out of the application.
- **Ticket Registration**
  - Users can register new traffic violation tickets. This function requires inputting relevant details such as the violator’s name, the violation type, and other pertinent information.
- **Search Functionality**
  - **Search by Name:** Allows users to find tickets based on the violator's name.
  - **Search by Ticket Number:** Enables quick access to specific tickets using the unique ticket number.
- **View Tickets**
  - **View All Tickets:** Displays a list of all registered tickets, providing an overview of all traffic violations recorded in the system.
  - **View Tickets by Category:** Users can filter and view tickets by specific categories, such as violations for "No License," making it easier to manage and analyze specific types of infractions.
- **Performance Tracking**
  - **Search and Index Time:** Measures the time taken to execute searches and index data, allowing users to monitor and optimize application performance.
